# Life-Expectancy-Analysis

Life expectancy serves as a crucial indicator of a populationâ€™s overall health and quality of life, reflecting the impact of healthcare systems, economic stability, and social conditions. Over recent decades, global life expectancy has seen significant improvements, rising from 65 years in 1990 to approximately 73 years in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2021). Despite these advancements, substantial disparities persist between high-income and low-income regions. For instance, while countries like Japan and Switzerland boast life expectancies over 84 years, some low-income nations still report life expectancies below 65 years (World Bank, 2023).

By analyzing life expectancy data, we can uncover significant patterns and disparities that reveal much about the progress and challenges faced by different regions and communities. 

To explore these relationships in detail, we will utilize the dataset available on Kaggle : [Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank), sourced from World Bank dataset. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of life expectancy alongside various socio-economic indicators, including sanitation, undernourishment, unemployment, corruption, GDP per capita and health expenditure for 200 countries from 2000 to 2019. 

By employing descriptive and prescriptive analytics techniques, we aim to identify trends, draw comparisons, and provide actionable insights into how sanitation, undernourishment, and health expenditure impact life expectancy across different countries and over time. Also, we are trying to do a case study on socio-economic factors that has affected life expectancy of India over the years.
