# Global Life Expectancy Analysis (2000-2019): Insights & Recommendations from World Bank Data based on ML Clustering

Hello, As part of my Final project of Decision Support and Business Intelligence class, for a social cause, I aim to analyze life expectancy data to identify key focus and improvement areas, ultimately providing actionable recommendations for enhancing public health outcomes.

I have built a tableau dashboard with the data collected to understand regional disparities and the socio-economic factors that influence mortality and life expectancy.

**Please take a look at Tableau Public dashboard:** [World Bank Mortality Analysis](https://public.tableau.com/views/FactorsInfluencingMortalityRatesAcrosstheGlobeWorldBankDataAnalysis/WorldBankMortalityAnalysis?:language=en-US&:sid=&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Please take a look at the extensive report on Life Expectancy Analysis:** [Global Life Expectancy Report](https://github.com/Haripriya9851/Global-Life-Expectancy-Analysis-2000-2019-Insights-from-World-Bank-Data/blob/main/Global%20Life%20Expectancy%20Analysis_Final.pdf)

# Problem Statement

Life expectancy serves as a crucial indicator of a population’s overall health and quality of life, reflecting the impact of healthcare systems, economic stability, and social conditions. Over recent decades, global life expectancy has seen significant improvements, rising from 65 years in 1990 to approximately 73 years in 2019 (World Health Organization, 2021). Despite these advancements, substantial disparities persist between high-income and low-income regions. For instance, while countries like Japan and Switzerland boast life expectancies over 84 years, some low-income nations still report life expectancies below 65 years (World Bank, 2023).

By analyzing life expectancy data, we can uncover significant patterns and disparities that reveal much about the progress and challenges faced by different regions and communities. 

To explore these relationships in detail, I utilized 2 datasets available on Kaggle : 

1. [Country Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohan0301/unsupervised-learning-on-country-data/data), sourced from Kaggle to categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.
2. [Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mjshri23/life-expectancy-and-socio-economic-world-bank), sourced from World Bank dataset. This dataset provides a comprehensive view of life expectancy alongside various socio-economic indicators, including sanitation, undernourishment, unemployment, corruption, GDP per capita and health expenditure for 200 countries from 2000 to 2019. 

By employing descriptive and prescriptive analytics techniques, I aim to identify trends, draw comparisons, and provide actionable insights into how sanitation, undernourishment, and health expenditure impact life expectancy across different countries and over time. Also, I am trying to do a case study on socio-economic factors that has affected life expectancy of India over the years.

Below are my Insights & Recommendation of the same:

# Insights and Recommendations:

Based on the insights from visualizations and the case study on India, policies that helped countries improve the health, emphasizes that Sanitation, undernourishment, and health expenditure are critical socio-economic factors influencing life expectancy. Based on geographical data, it’s evident that South Asia, Africa, and developing countries of Europe are still in need of adequate resources to upgrade their life with proper sanitation, nutrition and healthcare. Here are the prescriptions for authorities to improve the health of the people in these nations:

**1.	Enhance Sanitation and Nutrition:** Investments in sanitation and nutrition are critical, particularly in regions with low life expectancy, to reduce disease and malnutrition.

**2.	Implement Targeted Public Health Programs:** As discussed in Regional Health Programs Comparison, it’s important to focus on diseases and health issues prevalent in low life expectancy regions, such as infectious diseases in Sub-Saharan Africa and malnutrition in South Asia.

**3.	Accessible Health Systems:** Develop robust health systems with better access to healthcare services, medical supplies, and trained health professionals.

**4.	Increase Health Expenditure:** Developing countries should prioritize increasing their health expenditure as a percentage of GDP to improve healthcare infrastructure and access.

**5.	International Support and Collaboration:** Encourage international aid and collaboration to provide financial and technical support to the most affected regions, ensuring sustainable health improvements.
